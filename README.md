# db-unit-extractor

**db-unit-extractor** is a database extractor for unit testing. Rather than a massive data extractor, its goal is to extract a dataset for unit testing. Where, given a record seed and some schema information, a data file is generated to be loaded into tests integrated with a database using frameworks such as [dbunit](https://www.dbunit.org/) and [h2](https://www.h2database.com) for example.
